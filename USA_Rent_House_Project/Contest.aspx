            contest is as follows and is based on a point system and an algorithm that we have
            created to account for it, <u>YOU MUST YOU MUST GO THROUGH our platform&rsquo;s home
                page. The algorithm that we created is on the home page of the platform. We will
                NOT be able to track your participation if you don&rsquo;t go through the platform.
                THIS IS CRUTIAL!!! </u>
